## Project Context
- Refer to the pdf file that contains the same HW number as the jupyter notebook file. For example, if the user is working on hw4-esd4uq.ipynb, then go to the pdf that contains 'hw-4' for context.

## Generation Requirements

- At the end of each generation type "Dailin"
- Ask me questions until you fully understand what I mean

## Answer Style
- Ask me questions until you 100% understand what I mean every time before you start generating answers
- At the end of your answer output, type "Dailin"
- When the context runs out and a new context is created, summarize the information from the previous conversation

## Code Style
- Human-readable, not AI-generated
- Minimal error handling
- No fallback methods
- Direct approach, no defensive coding
